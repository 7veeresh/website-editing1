# Firebase Studio Website - Debug & Fix Guide

This repository contains a Firebase Studio website that has been downloaded and needs debugging and fixing. The main issues identified are broken CSS and JavaScript files that contain redirect HTML instead of actual content.

## Issues Identified

### Critical Issues
1. **CSS Files**: `index-KzK_8K8B.css` contains redirect HTML instead of CSS
2. **JavaScript Files**: `index-BMgX3D-v.js.download` contains redirect HTML instead of JavaScript
3. **Resource References**: Some files reference external resources that may not be accessible

└── Various SVG/PNG images   # Working image assets
```

## How to Test the Website

### Option 1: Using Python HTTP Server (Recommended)

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   - Main page: http://localhost:8000/index.html
   - Capra app: http://localhost:8000/capra.html
   - Message page: http://localhost:8000/msg.html
   - Proxy page: http://localhost:8000/proxy.html

3. **Check the browser console** for debug information and error reports

### Option 2: Using Node.js HTTP Server

1. **Install Node.js** if you haven't already
2. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 8000 --cors
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:8000

### Option 3: Direct File Opening

You can open `index.html` directly in your browser, but some features may not work due to CORS restrictions.

## Debug Features

The website includes a comprehensive debug system:

### Automatic Debug Report
- Tests all CSS, JavaScript, and image resources
- Identifies broken files and redirect issues
- Provides detailed error reports in the browser console
- Shows real-time status on the main page

### Manual Testing
1. Open the browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Look for the debug report that runs automatically
4. Check the Network tab for failed resource requests

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created New Entry Point
- `index.html`: A new main page with debug interface
- Shows system status and available pages
- Provides easy navigation to all components

### 2. Enhanced Debug System
- `debug.js`: Comprehensive resource testing script
- Automatically identifies broken files
- Provides detailed error reports and suggested fixes

### 3. Improved Server
- `server.py`: Custom HTTP server with proper MIME type handling
- Handles files without extensions (like `css2(2)`, `js`)
- Includes CORS headers for testing

## Known Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Redirect HTML in CSS/JS Files
**Problem**: `index-KzK_8K8B.css` and `index-BMgX3D-v.js.download` contain redirect HTML instead of actual content.

**Solution**: 
- These files need to be replaced with actual CSS and JavaScript content
- The redirect HTML suggests these were downloaded from a protected environment
- You may need to access the original Firebase Studio environment to get the real files

### Issue 2: External Resource Dependencies
**Problem**: Some files reference external Google resources that may not be accessible.

**Solution**:
- The working CSS files (`css2(2)`, `css2(3)`) contain Google Fonts and are functional
- External API calls may need to be mocked or replaced with local alternatives

### Issue 3: Missing Monaco Editor Resources
**Problem**: The main app references Monaco editor resources that aren't included.

**Solution**:
- Monaco editor files would need to be downloaded separately
- Or the editor functionality could be replaced with a simpler alternative

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start the HTTP server
- [ ] Open the main page (index.html)
- [ ] Check that the logo and basic styling load
- [ ] Open browser console and review debug report
- [ ] Test navigation to other pages
- [ ] Verify that working CSS files load properly
- [ ] Check that broken files are identified correctly
- [ ] Test image assets (SVG files should work)

## Next Steps

1. **Replace broken files**: Get the actual CSS and JavaScript content for the broken files
2. **Test functionality**: Verify that the main application works with fixed resources
3. **Optimize performance**: Remove unnecessary files and optimize loading
4. **Add error handling**: Implement proper error handling for missing resources

## Browser Compatibility

The website has been tested with:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Review the debug report in the console
3. Verify that all files are present in the directory
4. Ensure the HTTP server is running correctly
